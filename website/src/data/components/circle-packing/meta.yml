    CirclePacking chart with zooming ability.
    You can fully customize it using `nodeComponent` property
    to define your own node component,
    if you wish to do so you should have a look at
    [native SVG node component](https://github.com/plouc/nivo/blob/master/src/components/charts/bubble/BubbleNode.js)
    for available properties.

    The responsive alternative of this component is `ResponsiveCirclePacking`.
    It also offers various implementations, see
    [CirclePackingHtml](self:/circle-packing/html) and
    [CirclePackingCanvas](self:/circle-packing/canvas).

    This component is available in the `@nivo/api`,
    see [sample](api:/samples/circle-packing.svg)
    or [try it using the API client](self:/circle-packing/api).
    You can also see more example usages in
    [the storybook](storybook:circle-packing--default).

CirclePackingHtml:
  package: '@nivo/circle-packing'

    A variation around the [CirclePacking](self:/circle-packing) component. Well suited
    for large data sets as it does not impact DOM tree depth, however
    you'll lose the isomorphic ability and transitions (for now).

    The responsive alternative of this component is `ResponsiveCirclePackingCanvas`.
    It also offers various implementations, see
    [CirclePacking](self:/circle-packing) and [CirclePackingHtml](self:/circle-packing/html).
